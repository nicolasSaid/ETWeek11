/**
 * QUESTIONS:
 * 3. How can we build a Huffman Tree to represent the Huffman Encoding of a string?
 *      Try and create a Huffman Tree for the string: "Banana"
 *      Note: Huffman trees are not unique, so if your tree looks differnt than someone elses, don't worry!
 * 
 * 4. After creating a Huffman Tree, how can we convert our string into binary?
 *      Try and convert Banana into binary!
